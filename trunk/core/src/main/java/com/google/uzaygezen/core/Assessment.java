/**
 * The result of the user assessment of the spatial relationship between one
 * spatial object and the query region. The following states are representable:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link SpatialRelation#DISJOINT} with a {@code 0} (zero) {@link
 *  Assessment#estimate} means that there is no way the spatial object could
 *  overlap with points in the data set. That implies that the user doesn't care
 *  if the spatial object is filtered out or not from the final query
 *  expression, since it will not contain any points anyway.</li>
 *  <li>{@link SpatialRelation#DISJOINT} with a positive {@link
 *  Assessment#estimate} means that the spatial object is disjoint with the
 *  query region, but the spatial object is estimated to contain {@code
 *  estimate} data set points. This gap size estimate is later used to decide
 *  which consecutive ranges should be joined into one contiguous range, trying
 *  to minimise the number of included points that are not useful to the user,
 *  when there is a constraint on the number of ranges of the query expression
 *  being created.</li>
 *  <li>{@link SpatialRelation#COVERED} with a non-null {@link
 *  Assessment#filter} means that the spatial object's sub-space identified by
 *  the filter is fully included in the query region, or that the user doesn't
 *  want to zoom any deeper in the multidimensional space and that filtering of
 *  unneeded points can be done later, outside the space filling framework.
 *  Although the filter object is not allowed to be null, it will commonly
 *  represent a no-op filtering.</li>
 *  <li>{@link SpatialRelation#OVERLAPS} means that the spatial object overlaps,
 *  but is neither disjoint nor included in the query region, or that the user
 *  can't figure out what's the exact relationship and wants to zoom into the
 *  region.</li>
 * </ul>
