/**
 * Combiner of two space filling curve index ranges with attached filters.
 * Because the number of index ranges that a query expression must have is
 * limited, this abstraction allows one to customise the operation of joining
 * together two consecutive ranges, while still preserving some filtering of the
 * extraneous data inside. Thus while the index ranges are an inclusive
 * mechanism, this is the exclusive mechanism that works inside an index range.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are free to filter out all irrelevant data, or only some of
 * it, if at all. If the former happens for each call, and in addition to that,
 * the {@link SpaceVisitor} never returns {@link SpatialRelation#COVERED} when
 * there is a chance for extraneous points in that particular orthotope, the
 * framework guarantees that that no irrelevant data points will be selected by
 * the query. On the other hand, if the filter object stats getting too big, an
 * implementation is free to create a filter that doesn't filter anything at
 * all. But in that case extraneous points might (and probably will) be selected
 * by the constructed query.
